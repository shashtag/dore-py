# Examples

Each example within this directory is intended to provide a complete working copy of manifests which
illustrate a certain use case.

* [tpch](./tpch): Manifests for the [TPC-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/default5.asp) schema for each protocol 
  supported by Dore.


* [nested docs](./nested-docs): Creating models with attributes whose values can in turn be other
  documents. That is, a model's record is actually nested as an attribute's value.
